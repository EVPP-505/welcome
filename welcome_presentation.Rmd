## Welcome to Env Data & the R Language!!

## About Me

>- My name is Enrique Lugardo Monta&ntilde;o
>- People also call me Tres, which is 3 in Spanish
>- Because Iâ€™m the 3^rd^ "Henry"
>- I love dogs

-----------

```{r dogs, out.width="30%"}
d1 <- c("~/Pictures/puppies/truman.jpg", "~/Pictures/puppies/coco.jpg",
        "~/Pictures/puppies/stella.jpg")
include_graphics(d1)
```


## ... still me

I received a PhD in Geographical Sciences from the University of Maryland

>- so now it's ...
>- **Dr.** Enrique L. Monta&ntilde;o

>- I am remote sensing & geographical scientist

>- I am currently a Mendenhall Fellow - Research Geographer at the USGS

## ... and now

Adjunct Professor  
Environmental Science and Policy Department  
George Mason University  

> - This is my **VERY** first class

## Why are we here?

>- To learn R of course!

## But, what is R?

>- That's a silly question!
>- R is the `r match("R", LETTERS)`^th^ letter of the alphabet.

---------

How do we know that?

Because I used a function to find it

```{r echo=TRUE}
match("R", LETTERS)
```


## So again, what is R

 >- R is a computing language
 >- It was born of the S language from Bell Labs in the 1970's
 >- R became the open source version of S in the 1990's
 >- It's well known for statistics
 >- But, modern implementations have become a powerful, multi-purpose language
 
 --------
 
From the [R-Project Webpage](https://www.r-project.org/about.html):
 
> Many users think of R as a statistics system. We prefer to think of it of an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be extended (easily) via *packages*. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.


## Why R?

>- R provides an integrated environment for data science
>- That means we can both process and visualize data in the same environment
>- R is powerful and is **growing**
>- There is a strong community around R
>- That means help is available
>- Most of all, I think R is *approachable*


## About class

>- Participation
